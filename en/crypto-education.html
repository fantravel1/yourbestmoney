          <h2 id="what-is-crypto-heading">What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
          <p>Before diving into specific coins, protocols, or strategies, let's build a solid understanding of what cryptocurrency actually is and why it was created.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">

            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>At its core, cryptocurrency runs on <strong>blockchain</strong> — a digital ledger that records every transaction across a network of computers. Think of it like a shared spreadsheet that everyone can see but no single person controls. Once information is recorded, it's nearly impossible to change or delete.</p>
            <p>This decentralized structure is the key innovation: no bank, government, or company controls the system. Instead, it's maintained by thousands of computers around the world, all agreeing on the same record of transactions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <div class="content-card-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128176;</div>
            <h3>Digital Money</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is <strong>digital money</strong> that can be sent directly between people without needing a bank or payment processor. It exists only on the internet — there are no physical coins or bills. When you "own" Bitcoin, you own a digital record on the blockchain that says a certain amount belongs to your wallet address.</p>
            <p>Different cryptocurrencies serve different purposes: some aim to be digital cash (Bitcoin), others power software platforms (Ethereum), and some maintain stable value pegged to dollars (stablecoins).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <div class="content-card-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#128272;</div>
            <h3>Cryptography</h3>
            <p>The "crypto" in cryptocurrency comes from <strong>cryptography</strong> — the science of secure communication. Every transaction is secured by complex mathematics that make it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double-spend coins. Your wallet is protected by a private key — a long string of characters that only you should know.</p>
            <p>This is why protecting your private keys and seed phrase is absolutely critical. Whoever has your keys controls your funds — there is no bank to call for a password reset.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <div class="content-card-icon" aria-hidden="true">&#127760;</div>
            <h3>Why It Was Created</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was created in 2009 by the pseudonymous <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The idea: create a financial system that doesn't depend on banks or governments that can fail, print unlimited money, or freeze your accounts.</p>
            <p>Whether you agree with that vision or not, understanding the <em>why</em> helps you evaluate the <em>what</em>. Crypto was born from a desire for financial sovereignty — the ability to control your own money without intermediaries.</p>

          <span class="section-label">The Original</span>
          <h2 id="bitcoin-heading">Bitcoin: Digital Gold</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin is the first, largest, and most well-known cryptocurrency. Here's what you need to understand about it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9939; What Makes Bitcoin Special</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin has a <strong>fixed supply of 21 million coins</strong> — no more will ever be created. This scarcity is built into the code, making it fundamentally different from government currencies where central banks can print more money. About 19.6 million Bitcoin have already been mined, with the remaining coins being released gradually until approximately the year 2140.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin operates 24/7, can be sent anywhere in the world in minutes, and doesn't require permission from any institution. It has the largest network effect — more users, more miners, more merchants, more trust — than any other cryptocurrency.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9874; How Mining Works</h3>
            <p><strong>Mining</strong> is the process by which new Bitcoin are created and transactions are verified. Specialized computers compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The winner adds the next "block" of transactions to the blockchain and receives newly created Bitcoin as a reward.</p>
            <p>This process — called <strong>Proof of Work</strong> — requires significant electricity and computing power, which is why Bitcoin mining's energy use is a legitimate environmental concern. However, a growing percentage of mining operations now use renewable energy sources.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128200; The Halving</h3>
            <p>Approximately every four years, the Bitcoin mining reward is cut in half — an event called the <strong>"halving."</strong> When Bitcoin launched in 2009, miners received 50 BTC per block. After the 2024 halving, the reward dropped to 3.125 BTC. This predictable reduction in new supply is a key part of Bitcoin's economic design.</p>
            <p>Historically, halvings have preceded significant price increases, though past performance never guarantees future results. Understanding the halving helps you understand why some people view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128202; Bitcoin's Volatility</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin's price can swing 10-20% or more in a single day. It has experienced drawdowns of 50-80% multiple times in its history. This extreme volatility is why Bitcoin is considered a <strong>high-risk asset</strong> and why you should never invest money you can't afford to lose.</p>
            <p>Volatility cuts both ways: Bitcoin has also been one of the best-performing assets over the past decade. The key is understanding your own risk tolerance and time horizon before deciding if — and how much — exposure makes sense for you.</p>

          <h2 id="ethereum-heading">Ethereum &amp; Smart Contracts</h2>
          <p>Ethereum expanded the blockchain concept beyond simple payments into a programmable platform for decentralized applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128187; What Is Ethereum?</h3>
            <p>If Bitcoin is "digital gold," Ethereum is more like a <strong>"digital computer"</strong> — a programmable blockchain that can run applications. Created by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced <strong>smart contracts</strong>: self-executing programs that run automatically when predetermined conditions are met.</p>
            <p>Ethereum's native cryptocurrency is called <strong>Ether (ETH)</strong>, and it's used to pay for transactions and computational power on the network. ETH is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128220; Smart Contracts Explained</h3>
            <p>A <strong>smart contract</strong> is code that executes automatically when specific conditions are met — like a digital vending machine. You put in the right input, and the output is guaranteed by the code, not by trust in a person or company.</p>
            <p>Example: A smart contract could hold funds in escrow and automatically release payment to a seller when a buyer confirms receipt of goods. No lawyer, no bank, no middleman needed. This has applications in finance, real estate, insurance, supply chains, and more.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#127968; Decentralized Applications (dApps)</h3>
            <p><strong>dApps</strong> are applications built on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Unlike traditional apps controlled by a single company (like Facebook or your banking app), dApps run on decentralized networks and their rules are governed by smart contracts.</p>
            <p>Popular dApp categories include: decentralized exchanges (swap tokens without a middleman), lending platforms (borrow and lend crypto), NFT marketplaces, gaming, and identity verification systems.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9889; The Merge &amp; Proof of Stake</h3>
            <p>In September 2022, Ethereum completed "The Merge" — switching from energy-intensive Proof of Work mining to <strong>Proof of Stake</strong>. Instead of miners competing with computing power, validators now "stake" (lock up) ETH as collateral to process transactions and earn rewards.</p>
            <p>This reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by approximately 99.95% and changed how new ETH is issued. Staking allows everyday users to earn yields on their ETH, though staked funds are subject to lockup periods and potential "slashing" penalties for validator misbehavior.</p>

    <!-- ========== OTHER MAJOR CRYPTOCURRENCIES ========== -->
    <section class="section section-cream" aria-labelledby="other-crypto-heading">

        <div class="section-header animate-on-scroll">
          <span class="section-label">The Landscape</span>
          <h2 id="other-crypto-heading">Other Major Cryptocurrencies</h2>
          <p>Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, thousands of cryptocurrencies exist. Most are not worth your attention. Here are the categories that matter.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-3 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128178; Stablecoins</h3>
            <p><strong>Stablecoins</strong> are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Examples include USDC, USDT (Tether), and DAI.</p>
            <p>They serve as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto — useful for sending money internationally, earning yield, or parking funds between trades without converting back to dollars.</p>
            <p><strong>Key risk:</strong> Not all stablecoins are backed equally. USDC is audited and backed by cash reserves; others may have questionable backing. Always verify what backs a stablecoin before trusting it with your money.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9889; Layer 1 Platforms</h3>
            <p>Several blockchains compete with Ethereum as programmable platforms: <strong>Solana</strong> (fast, low fees), <strong>Cardano</strong> (academic approach), <strong>Avalanche</strong> (subnet architecture), and <strong>Polkadot</strong> (cross-chain interoperability).</p>
            <p>Each makes different trade-offs between speed, security, and decentralization. These are speculative investments — most alternative layer 1s have yet to prove they can sustain long-term network effects comparable to Ethereum.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9888; The Long Tail</h3>
            <p>There are over <strong>20,000 cryptocurrencies</strong>, and the vast majority will go to zero. Meme coins, low-cap tokens, and "the next Bitcoin" pitches are overwhelmingly likely to lose you money.</p>
            <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If a crypto project promises guaranteed returns, has no clear utility, or relies heavily on hype and celebrity endorsements, treat it as a red flag. Stick to understanding the major projects before exploring smaller ones.</p>

          <h2 id="defi-heading">DeFi: Decentralized Finance</h2>
          <p>DeFi recreates traditional financial services — lending, borrowing, trading, insurance — using smart contracts instead of banks. It's powerful but carries significant risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#127974; What DeFi Offers</h3>
            <p><strong>Lending &amp; Borrowing:</strong> Platforms like Aave and Compound let you lend your crypto to earn interest or borrow against your holdings. Rates are determined by supply and demand, not by a bank.</p>
            <p><strong>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):</strong> Swap tokens directly with other users through automated smart contracts. No account required, no KYC, no central authority. Uniswap is the most well-known.</p>
            <p><strong>Yield Farming &amp; Staking:</strong> Earn returns by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols or staking tokens to secure networks.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#9888; DeFi Risks</h3>
            <p><strong>Smart Contract Risk:</strong> If a smart contract has a bug, your funds can be stolen or locked permanently. Billions of dollars have been lost to exploits.</p>
            <p><strong>Impermanent Loss:</strong> Providing liquidity to trading pools can result in losses if the price of your deposited tokens changes significantly.</p>
            <p><strong>Rug Pulls:</strong> Dishonest developers can create fake DeFi projects, attract deposits, and then drain all funds. This is extremely common with new, unaudited protocols.</p>
            <p><strong>Regulatory Risk:</strong> DeFi operates in a legal gray area. Regulations could change how these platforms work or whether they're accessible in your jurisdiction.</p>

          <p style="margin:0;"><strong>&#128161; Our Recommendation:</strong> DeFi is fascinating technology but is NOT for beginners. Build a solid foundation in traditional investing and basic crypto understanding before exploring DeFi. When you do explore, use only reputable, audited protocols and start with very small amounts you can afford to lose entirely.</p>

          <h2 id="nft-heading">NFTs &amp; Digital Ownership</h2>
          <p>NFTs represent unique digital ownership verified on a blockchain. Beyond the hype, the technology has real applications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>What Are NFTs?</h3>
            <p><strong>NFT</strong> stands for Non-Fungible Token. While Bitcoin and dollars are "fungible" (one is identical to another), each NFT is unique — like a deed, certificate, or serial number on the blockchain.</p>
            <p>NFTs can represent: digital art, music, event tickets, real estate deeds, academic credentials, medical records, gaming items, and any other unique digital or physical asset that benefits from verifiable ownership.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
            <p>The 2021-2022 NFT art craze saw millions spent on digital images, most of which lost 90%+ of their value. This speculative bubble gave NFTs a bad reputation, but it's important to separate the <em>technology</em> from the <em>speculation</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Don't buy NFTs expecting them to increase in value. The technology of verifiable digital ownership is promising, but treating NFTs as investments is extremely speculative and high-risk.</p>

          <h2 id="safety-heading">Crypto Security &amp; Safety</h2>
          <p>Security is the most important topic in crypto. Unlike a bank, there is no customer service to call if something goes wrong. You are your own bank — and that means security is your responsibility.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128273; Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets</h3>
            <p><strong>Hot wallets</strong> are connected to the internet — apps on your phone, browser extensions like MetaMask, or exchange accounts. They're convenient for frequent use but more vulnerable to hacking.</p>
            <p><strong>Cold wallets</strong> (hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor) store your private keys offline. They're the most secure way to store significant amounts of crypto. Think of it like this: hot wallet = your everyday checking account; cold wallet = your safe deposit box.</p>
            <p><strong>Rule:</strong> If you hold more than a few hundred dollars in crypto, get a hardware wallet.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128272; Your Seed Phrase Is Everything</h3>
            <p>When you create a crypto wallet, you receive a <strong>seed phrase</strong> — typically 12 or 24 words. This phrase is the master key to your funds. Anyone who has it can take everything. If you lose it, your funds are gone forever.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Write it down on paper</strong> — never store it digitally (no photos, no cloud, no notes app)</li>
              <li><strong>Store it in a fireproof, waterproof safe</strong> or multiple secure locations</li>
              <li><strong>Never share it</strong> — no legitimate service, company, or support team will ever ask for your seed phrase</li>
              <li><strong>Consider a metal backup</strong> — seed phrase engraved on stainless steel survives fire and flood</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128737; Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
            <p>Enable <strong>2FA</strong> on every crypto exchange and service you use. This adds a second layer of security beyond your password.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Best:</strong> Hardware security key (YubiKey)</li>
              <li><strong>Good:</strong> Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)</li>
              <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> SMS-based 2FA — your phone number can be stolen through "SIM swapping"</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128270; Verify Everything</h3>
            <p>In crypto, there is no "undo" button. Once a transaction is sent, it's final.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Triple-check wallet addresses</strong> before sending funds — one wrong character means lost money</li>
              <li><strong>Send a small test transaction first</strong> before transferring large amounts</li>
              <li><strong>Bookmark exchange URLs</strong> and navigate directly — never click links in emails</li>

            <p>A group buys large amounts of a low-value token, then promotes it aggressively on social media ("this coin is going to the moon!"). As new buyers drive up the price, the original group sells everything, crashing the price and leaving latecomers with worthless tokens.</p>
            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Any "urgent" recommendation to buy a specific cryptocurrency, especially from social media influencers or Telegram/Discord groups.</p>

            <h3>&#127917; Rug Pulls</h3>

            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Anonymous team, unaudited smart contracts, unusually high yields ("1000% APY!"), and no lock on developer tokens.</p>

            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Slightly misspelled URLs, unsolicited direct messages, "support" reaching out to you first, requests to "verify your wallet."</p>

            <p>Someone builds a relationship with you (often on dating apps or social media) then gradually introduces a "guaranteed" crypto investment opportunity. They may show fake profits and encourage you to invest more and more. Also called "pig butchering" scams.</p>
            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Anyone you've met online who encourages you to move money to a specific platform, shows you screenshots of amazing returns, or pressures you to invest quickly.</p>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#129464; Fake Celebrity Endorsements</h3>
            <p>Scammers use deepfakes, fake social media accounts, or hacked verified accounts to make it appear that celebrities are endorsing a specific cryptocurrency or giveaway.</p>
            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> "Elon Musk is doubling your Bitcoin!" — No legitimate giveaway requires you to send money first. Ever.</p>

            <h3>&#128241; Fake Apps &amp; Wallets</h3>

            <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Apps with low download counts, poor reviews, or slightly different names from well-known services. Always download from official links on the project's verified website.</p>

          <span class="section-label">Step by Step</span>
          <h2 id="how-to-buy-heading">How to Buy Your First Cryptocurrency</h2>
          <p>If you've decided to explore crypto with money you can afford to lose, here's a responsible step-by-step guide.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-1 animate-on-scroll" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 1: Get Your Financial Foundation Right</h3>
            <p>Before buying any crypto: &#10003; Emergency fund in place (3-6 months expenses) &#10003; High-interest debt paid off &#10003; Basic investments started (retirement account, index funds) &#10003; Crypto money is money you can 100% afford to lose.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 2: Choose a Reputable Exchange</h3>
            <p>Use well-established, regulated exchanges. Look for: proper regulatory licenses, transparent fee structures, strong security track record, insurance on custodied assets, and responsive customer support. Complete your identity verification (KYC) before depositing funds.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 3: Secure Your Account</h3>
            <p>Use a unique, strong password (at least 16 characters). Enable 2FA with an authenticator app (not SMS). Set up withdrawal address whitelisting if available. Consider using a dedicated email address just for crypto.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 4: Start Very Small</h3>
            <p>Your first purchase should be an amount that would not affect your life if it went to zero tomorrow. $20-$50 is a perfectly fine starting point. The goal is to <em>learn the mechanics</em> of buying, holding, and transferring — not to get rich quick.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 5: Stick to Major Cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <p>As a beginner, limit yourself to Bitcoin (BTC) and/or Ethereum (ETH). These have the longest track records, largest networks, and most liquidity. Avoid the temptation of small, hyped-up altcoins until you have a strong understanding of the space.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 6: Move to Self-Custody (When Ready)</h3>
            <p>Once your holdings grow beyond what you'd keep in a wallet on the street, transfer them to a hardware wallet you control. This means you — not the exchange — hold your private keys. "Not your keys, not your coins" is a foundational crypto principle.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>Step 7: Keep Records for Taxes</h3>
            <p>Every buy, sell, swap, and transfer is a potentially taxable event. Keep detailed records from day one. Use a crypto tax tracking tool to automate this. Don't wait until tax season to figure it out — that's a painful mistake many people make.</p>

          <h2 id="risk-heading">Risk Management for Crypto</h2>
          <p>Managing risk is the difference between learning and losing everything. These principles protect you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-grid-2 animate-on-scroll">
          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128176; Position Sizing</h3>
            <p>Most financial advisors suggest that crypto should make up <strong>no more than 1-5% of your total investment portfolio</strong>. If the thought of your entire crypto allocation going to zero would cause you financial distress, you have too much in crypto.</p>
            <p>A common approach: decide on a maximum dollar amount you're comfortable losing, and never exceed it regardless of how "obvious" an opportunity seems.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128200; Dollar-Cost Averaging</h3>
            <p>Instead of trying to time the market (which even professionals fail at consistently), invest a fixed small amount at regular intervals. $25/month into Bitcoin regardless of price is a disciplined approach that removes emotion from the equation.</p>
            <p>This strategy means you'll buy more when prices are low and less when prices are high, naturally averaging your cost over time.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128683; Never Use Leverage</h3>
            <p><strong>Leveraged trading</strong> (borrowing money to trade) in crypto is one of the fastest ways to lose everything. A 10x leveraged Bitcoin position means a 10% drop wipes out your entire investment. The crypto market moves 10% regularly.</p>
            <p>Professional traders with decades of experience lose money on leveraged crypto. As a learning investor, avoid it completely.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#129504; Emotional Discipline</h3>
            <p><strong>FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):</strong> When prices are surging and everyone on social media is celebrating gains, you'll feel pressure to buy. This is usually the worst time to buy.</p>
            <p><strong>Panic selling:</strong> When prices crash and fear dominates, you'll want to sell everything. This is usually the worst time to sell.</p>
            <p>Having a plan <em>before</em> emotions hit is the only reliable protection. Write down your rules and follow them.</p>

              <li>Selling crypto for cash (capital gain/loss)</li>

          <div class="content-card">
            <h3>&#128221; Record Keeping</h3>

            <p>Start keeping records from your very first purchase. Use a dedicated crypto tax tool that connects to your exchanges and wallets to track this automatically. Tax rules vary by country — consult a tax professional familiar with crypto in your jurisdiction.</p>

                No investment is completely "safe," but cryptocurrency is among the most volatile and risky asset classes. Prices can drop 50% or more in weeks. There is also the risk of exchange hacks, scams, regulatory changes, and losing access to your funds through lost keys. That said, Bitcoin and Ethereum have survived multiple market cycles and have been adopted by institutional investors. The key is proper position sizing — only allocate money you can afford to lose completely.

                Generally, no. A solid financial foundation should come first: emergency fund, employer-matched retirement contributions, basic index fund investing, and debt management. Crypto is a speculative asset that should complement — not replace — a traditional investment strategy. Think of it as the top of the pyramid, not the base.

                Most exchanges allow you to buy as little as $1-$10 worth of cryptocurrency. You don't need to buy a whole Bitcoin (which costs tens of thousands of dollars) — you can buy a fraction. Starting small is actually the best approach: it lets you learn the mechanics of buying, transferring, and securing crypto without risking meaningful money.

                In most countries, including the United States, Canada, the UK, and the EU, buying and holding cryptocurrency is legal. However, regulations vary widely and are evolving rapidly. Some countries have banned certain crypto activities, and tax requirements differ by jurisdiction. Always check the current laws in your country and consult a financial professional if unsure. Regulated exchanges operating in your country generally ensure you're complying with local laws.

                If you lose your seed phrase and also lose access to your wallet device, your funds are gone forever. There is no password reset, no customer service to call, and no way to recover the funds. This is by design — the same property that prevents anyone from stealing your crypto also means you are solely responsible for safekeeping. This is why storing your seed phrase securely in multiple locations is absolutely critical.

                Major regulated exchanges have significant security measures, but they are not risk-free. Exchanges have been hacked (Mt. Gox, 2014) and even major ones have collapsed (FTX, 2022). The crypto saying "not your keys, not your coins" reflects this: when your crypto is on an exchange, you're trusting that company with your assets. For long-term holding of significant amounts, self-custody with a hardware wallet is recommended.

                No. Studies consistently show that the vast majority of day traders lose money — and crypto's extreme volatility makes it even worse. Day trading also generates complex tax situations, high fees, and significant stress. A long-term holding strategy (buying and holding for years) has historically been far more effective for most investors. If you enjoy the excitement of trading, recognize it as entertainment, not investing, and only use money specifically allocated for that purpose.

                Bitcoin's Proof of Work mining consumes significant electricity — comparable to some small countries. This is a legitimate environmental concern. However, Ethereum's switch to Proof of Stake reduced its energy use by ~99.95%, and many newer blockchains use similarly energy-efficient systems. Additionally, a growing percentage of Bitcoin mining uses renewable energy. The environmental impact varies significantly by cryptocurrency and is an important factor to consider in your evaluation.
